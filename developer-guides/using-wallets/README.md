# ðŸ’° Wallets

## What is a wallet?

A wallet is one of Themelio's most important tools. It lets a user:

* buy, sell, store, and swap tokens
* interact with decentralized apps built on our blockchain
* control and own their own data; passwords, credentials, and funds are only accessible by the users themselves
