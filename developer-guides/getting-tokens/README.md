# ðŸª™ Getting tokens

There are currently only a couple of ways of acquiring **"mainnet"** tokens:

* Run a [`melminter`](using-melminter.md) instance - this rewards you with ERG, which can be immediately swapped for other tokens in the liquidity pools (e.g. MEL, SYM, etc.)
* If you already have some MEL, SYM, or ERG, you can swap them for others via [Melswap](../using-wallets/melswap-guide.md)

Testnet MEL can be arbitrarily created using the [faucet functionality](../using-wallets/getting-started.md#fund-wallet).

Our native tokens are currently **not** listed on any exchange yet. Be aware of possible scams!
