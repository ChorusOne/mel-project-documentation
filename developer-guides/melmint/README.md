description: A brief overview of Themelio's native assets

# ðŸª™ Coins (name WIP)

The Themelio network has three native currencies:

* `MEL` - the low-volatility base currency, representing traditional "money" on our network. It provides stable purchasing power, unit of account, store of value, etc. -- all the things you would normally expect of traditional money.
* `SYM` - a possibly volatile cryptocurrency that acts as our special proof-of-stake token; Stakers stake `SYM` to participate in protocol consensus. The protocol's value will accrue to this coin so it is the best way of "investing" in the Themelio protocol.
* `ERG` - a synthetic on-chain asset that is exponentially inflated. It is primarily used in the Melmint mechanism to help stabilize the value of `MEL`.
