# Introduction to MEL

## What is MEL?

`MEL` is an endogenous, self-stabilizing cryptocurrency that provides important functionality, such as:

* stable purchasing power, unit of account, and store of value
* serves as a protocol-internal unit of value for incentive design

`MEL` can be treated as a reliable form of stable "default" money that underpins the network's financial system.

## Why is MEL different?&#x20;

`MEL` is an **endogenous self-stabilizing cryptocurrency.**&#x20;

In other words, unlike existing fiat-pegged stablecoins like DAI or USDC, which rely on oracles and centralized issuers, `MEL` has an issuance mechanism entirely based on endogenous trust.

This means that mechanisms like Bitcoin’s issuance schedule, trusted parties are **NOT** involved at all — no central bank, no oracles, no DAOs, no governance!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

`MEL` relies on a mechanism called [Melmint](getting-tokens/minting-mel-with-melminter.md), which pegs **1 `MEL` to 1** [**`DOSC`**](getting-tokens/minting-mel-with-melminter.md#what-is-a-dosc)**.**&#x20;
