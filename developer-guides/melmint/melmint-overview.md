# Introduction to MEL

### Introduction to MEL&#x20;

MEL is an endogenous, low-volatility cryptocurrency that provides important functionality such as:

* stable purchasing power, unit of account, and store of value
* serving as protocol-internal units of value for incentive design.

Unlike existing fiat-pegged stablecoins, which rely on oracles and centralized issuers, MEL relies on an oracle-free system that does not peg MEL to any external asset. Instead, it has a mechanism called Melmint, which pegs **1 MEL to 1 DOSC.**

### What is a DOSC?

A “DOSC” is a “day of sequential computation”. It’s defined as the _cost of running a sequential computation for 24 hours, using the fastest processor available_.&#x20;

For example, a DOSC in the year 2000 is the cost of occupying the fastest single CPU core _available in 2000_ for 24 hours, while a DOSC in the year 2021 is the cost of doing the same with a 2021 processor.

### What makes DOSC a good peg target?

* It has a relatively stable purchasing power. Empirically, the “fastest processor” typically costs about the same, despite its performance drastically increasing over time. We explore this further in our [DOSC analysis data](https://github.com/themeliolabs/dosc-analysis).
* More importantly, it can be measured through a "sequential proof-of-work" on-chain by an autonomous mechanism with full endogenous trust.

In short, `MEL` can be treated as a reliable form of stable "default" money for the network.&#x20;
