# Introduction to MEL

## What is MEL?&#x20;

MEL is an endogenous, self-stabilizing cryptocurrency that provides important functionality, such as:

* stable purchasing power, unit of account, and store of value
* serves as a protocol-internal unit of value for incentive design

`MEL` can be treated as a reliable form of stable "default" money that underpins the networks' financial system.&#x20;

## Why is MEL different?&#x20;

`MEL` is an **endogenous self-stabilizing cryptocurrency.**&#x20;

Unlike existing fiat-pegged stablecoins like DAI or USDC, which rely on oracles and centralized issuers, MEL has an issuance mechanism entirely based on endogenous trust.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This means that mechanisms like Bitcoin’s issuance schedule, trusted parties are **NOT** involved at all — no central bank, no oracles, no DAOs, no governance!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

`MEL` relies on a mechanism called Melmint, which pegs **1 `MEL` to 1 `DOSC`.**

### What is a DOSC?

A “DOSC” is a “day of sequential computation”. It’s defined as the _cost of running a sequential computation for 24 hours, using the fastest processor available_.&#x20;

For example, a DOSC in the year 2000 is the cost of occupying the fastest single CPU core _available in 2000_ for 24 hours, while a DOSC in the year 2021 is the cost of doing the same with a 2021 processor.

### What makes DOSC a good peg target?

* It has a relatively stable purchasing power. Empirically, the “fastest processor” typically costs about the same, despite its performance drastically increasing over time. We explore this further in our [DOSC analysis data](https://github.com/themeliolabs/dosc-analysis).
* More importantly, it can be measured through a sequential proof-of-work on-chain by an autonomous mechanism with full endogenous trust.
