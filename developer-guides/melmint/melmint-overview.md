# Melmint overview

## Introduction

Melmint is the mechanism that issues and stabilizes `MEL`, an endogenous stablecoin. That is,

* It has an issuance mechanism entirely based on endogenous trust. That means that like Bitcoin’s issuance schedule, no trusted parties are involved at all — no central bank, no oracles, no DAOs.
* It nevertheless maintains a stable purchasing power.

Currently, most of the DeFi ecosystem relies on fiat-pegged stablecoins like `DAI` or `USDC`.
