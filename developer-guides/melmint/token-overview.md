# Token Overview

The Themelio network has three native currencies:

* `MEL`: the self-stabilizing base currency of the Themelio network. It provides stable purchasing power, unit of account, store of value, etc. -- all the things you would normally expect of traditional money.
* `SYM`: a potentially volatile cryptocurrency that acts as our special proof-of-stake token; stakers stake `SYM` to participate in protocol consensus. It will accrue the protocol's value and therefore it is the best way of "investing" in the Themelio protocol.
* `ERG`: a synthetic on-chain asset that is exponentially inflated. It is primarily used in the Melmint mechanism to help stabilize the value of `MEL`.
