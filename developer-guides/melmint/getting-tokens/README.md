# Getting Tokens

These are the currently available ways to get tokens:

* Run a [melminter](using-melminter.md) instance - this rewards you with `ERG`, which can be immediately swapped for other tokens in the liquidity pools (e.g. `MEL`, `SYM`, etc.)
* If you already have some `MEL`, `SYM`, or `ERG`, you can swap them for others via [Melswap.](../../using-wallets/melswap-guide.md)
* Our native tokens are currently not available for the public to purchase yet
