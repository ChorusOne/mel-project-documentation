# Melmint Overview

## Introduction

Melmint's main job is to make sure `MEL`, our self-stabilizing base currency, is pegged to a reliable value. In order to be a useful store of value, `MEL` must not have a volatile price like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Unlike existing conventional stablecoins, `MEL` does not rely on any external assets like fiats and oracles. Instead, Melmint is an oracle-free system that pegs the value of 1 `MEL` to 1 `DOSC`**.**

At a high level, running an instance of Melminter lets people contribute information about "the current price of computation" to the network.

## Participating in Melmint

To participate in Melmint, you can run your own instance of `melminter`

`ERG` itself is not a very useful currency on its own, so everyone would almost always want to sell it for something more valuable via [Melswap](../../../using-wallets/melswap-guide.md).

## Further Reading

This was just a quick overview of Melmint. The complete guide on how `MEL` is stabilized, along with what happens under the hood, can be found [here](../../../../concepts/sound-cryptoeconomics-with-truly-sound-money.md) in the conceptual documentation.
