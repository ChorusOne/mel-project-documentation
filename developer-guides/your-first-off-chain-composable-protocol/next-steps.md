* Moving things even more off-chain
  * Only have the hash on-chain
  * Use a P2P network (e.g. a DHT) to store the actual name binding
  * Lets us also get rid of the -1 state spam, as long as we can sacrifice proofs of nonexistence
* Binding human-readable names
  * Use a tree structure.
  * A little complicated, for another day
