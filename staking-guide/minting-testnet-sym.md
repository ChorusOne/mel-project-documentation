# Minting testnet SYM

## Prerequisites

### Getting MEL into your wallet

Follow this short [guide](../developer-guides/using-wallets/getting-started.md).

### Swap MEL for SYM

Once you have some MEL in your wallet, swap it for some SYM with the following command:

```shell-session
$ melwallet-cli send-faucet -w <wallet-name> --currency SYM --amount 10000
```

That's it! Now you have some testnet SYM to play with. To learn more about swapping, take a look at our quick [Melswap guide](../developer-guides/using-wallets/melswap-guide.md).
