# Decentralization beyond blockchains

## The current state of Web3

What even is Web3? The most literal interpretation is probably that "Web3" is simply any vision for a new internet ecosystem that succeeds Web2 and fixes its lack of privacy, insecurity, and pathological centralization, but in practice, Web3 refers to the world of blockchains and "crypto".&#x20;

And indeed, by combining incentives and cryptography, blockchains can achieve unprecedented decentralization and security. On general-purpose L1s like Ethereum, we now have a growing ecosystem of interoperable decentralized protocols, ranging from DeFi staples like the Compound lending platform to fascinatingly novel experiments like the cryptography game Dark Forest. Despite the technical barriers involved, UX is steadily improving and more and more regular users are using blockchains. The bright future of a new, better Web seems right around the corner.

But on a closer look, troubling cracks appear in this optimistic picture. Web2's problems seem to be cropping up yet again all over "Web3". _Talk about Infura, Tornado Cash, etc. How can a single entity shutting down easy access to decentralized infrastructure be compatible with Web3's vision?_

Moreover, there's a whole world of entirely non-blockchain "alt-tech" projects, all sharing the same goal of fixing Web2's problems and arguably parts of "Web3": Tor, Freenet, Matrix, and the like. Nearly all struggle to gain adoption due to the difficulty of successfully combining decentralization, usability, and security, a lack that blockchains seem ideally suited to fill. Yet puzzlingly, we don't see a lot of blockchain adoption in these projects that truly need decentralized security.

## The problem: Web3 stuck in itself
