### The killer feature of blockchains… <a href="#the-killer-feature-of-blockchains" id="the-killer-feature-of-blockchains"></a>

Themelio’s entire design is motivated by what we believe is the most important feature of blockchains: **endogenous trust**. That is, _we can trust that a blockchain protocol will behave correctly without trusting any of the people running it_. In blockchains, trust emerges from within the protocol, not from preexisting trust in the parties that run the protocol.

Endogenous trust is enabled by cryptoeconomics, the intersection of game theory and cryptography, which powers self-incentivizing mechanisms that, given enough participants, allows us to trust a group’s overall behavior without trusting any individual participant. For example, someone can only securely use a traditional bank if they trust that bank, or at least third-party regulators. But a Bitcoin user doesn’t even need to know which miner ends up processing their transaction, let alone establish any sort of trust with that miner. Instead, because the cryptoeconomics of Bitcoin mining internally rewards good miners and heavily punishes bad miners, our Bitcoin user can confidently trust the Bitcoin network as a whole.

In fact, endogenous trust is the only property unique to public blockchains. Almost all other widely-touted blockchain properties can be found in non-blockchain systems that are often much more efficient than blockchains: BitTorrent has decentralization, Keybase has transparency, and TLS has security, to name a few. Endogenous trust is the key feature that gives blockchain apps superpowers elusive to pre-blockchain systems.
