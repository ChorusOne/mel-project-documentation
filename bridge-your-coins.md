# ðŸŒ‰ Bridge your coins

## FancyName Overview

FancyName is a trustless, light-client relay that is natively verified and secured. It enables the transfer of Themelio coins to Ethereum and back, thus bootstrapping the Themelio ecosystem with all of the liquidity and defi potential available on the Ethereum network.

The functionality of the bridge is simple:

* to transfer coins from Themelio to Ethereum you first lock up the desired assets on the Themelio network and then provide proof of the locking transaction on the Ethereum side, where your coins will be minted as wrapped tokens
* to transfer your coins back to Themelio you would burn your tokens on Ethereum and then provide proof of the burn on the Themelio side, thus unlocking your coins

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: FancyName currently supports moving Themelio coins to Ethereum and back, but not the other way around (e.g. it cannot move ether to Themelio).
{% endhint %}

Now that we have a high-level overview of FancyName, let's get a closer look at its architecture.

## FancyName Architecture

As we mentioned earlier, FancyName is made up of two complementary components, a Themelio covenant and a set of Ethereum smart contracts. Both of these components work together to enable the transfer of assets on Themelio to Ethereum securely.

### The Themelio covenant

A Themelio covenant, somewhat analogous to a Bitcoin script, is a program attached to a coin (UTXO) that takes in a transaction and its execution context and decides whether or not that transaction can spend.

A bridging event is initiated by the locking up of any coin to the Themelio bridge covenant. This covenant locks coins until they are proven to have been burned on the Ethereum network, at which point the coins are released. The covenant is written in Themelio's high-level language, [Melodeon](https://melodeonlang.org), and its source code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/themeliolabs/bridge-covenants).

The FancyName covenant keeps track of Ethereum headers using Ethereum's native cryptographic primitives, trustlessly inheriting its security and allowing it to verify the contents of a particular storage mapping in the FancyName smart contracts; this enables it to unlock coins when their corresponding tokens have been burned.

### Covenant API

#### Locking coins

To lock coins up on the Themelio network, all that needs to be done is send a transaction to the covenant's address where:

* the first output of the transaction contains the coin that will be bridged
* the recipient's Ethereum address is encoded in the first outputs's `additional data` field.

#### Unlocking coins

To unlock coins, a transaction must be sent which attempts to spend the locked coin and has, in the `additional data` field of its first output, an encoded Merkle proof which proves the equivalent token amount was burned on Ethereum. This proof can be obtained by any Ethereum client.

### The Ethereum smart contracts

On the Ethereum network, the bridge is composed of a set of smart contracts which together enable light client verification of Themelio block headers, staker sets, and transactions. This is possible through the use Themelio's underlying cryptographic primitives which allow the smart contracts to trustlessly inherit Themelio's native security. The source code for the FancyName smart contracts can be viewed [here](https://github.com/themeliolabs/bridge-sol).

### Smart contracts API

#### leafHeights(bytes32 keccakStakesHash) returns (uint256 blockHeight)

This getter function should be used to check if a particular stakes tree datablock has already been verified and stored via `verifyStakes()` so you don't waste gas submitting it again.

* `keccakStakesHash`: the keccak256 hash of a stakes tree datablock

#### verifyStakes(bytes stakes) returns (bool)

This function is used for hashing a stakes byte array using blake3 and storing it in contract storage for subsequent verification of Themelio headers.

* `stakes`: a `bytes` array consisting of serialized and concatenated Themelio `StakeDoc`s, which each represent a certain amount of `sym` coins staked on the the themelio network for a specified amount of time by a specific public key. The `StakeDoc`s array is prepended with the amount of total `sym`s staked for the current and next epochs for more efficient verification of headers in the FancyName contracts.
* `blockHeight`: the block height of the header which will be used to verify the included stakes datablock
* `stakesDatablock`: a `bytes` consisting of a serialized Themelio stakes tree datablock
* `datablockIndex`: the index of the datablock within the stakes tree
* `stakesProof`: the Merkle proof used to prove inclusion of the datablock within `blockHeight` header's stakes hash

Returns `true` if `stakes` were successfully hashed and stored, reverts otherwise.

#### headers(uint256 blockHeight) returns (bytes32 transactionsHash, bytes32 stakesHash)

This getter function should be used to check if a header at a particular height has already been submitted so you don't waste gas submitting it again.

* `blockHeight`: the block height of the header

#### verifyHeader(bytes header, bytes32\[] signers, bytes32\[] signatures) returns (bool success)

Stores header information for a particular block height once the header has been verified through ed25519 signature verification of stakes worth at least 2/3 of total sym staked for that epoch.

The process of header verification can be completed in multiple transactions in the case of particularly computationally intensive verifications which exceed the block gas limit. In this case, progress is saved in an intermediary state until the header has enough votes for verification.

* `header`: the bincode serialized Themelio block header in `bytes`
* `signers`: array of 32-byte ed25519 public keys of stakers that have signed `header`, in `bytes32[]`
* `signatures`: array of 64-byte ed25519 staker signatures of `header` in the same order as `signers`, split into 32-byte `R` and 32-byte `s` (this means `signatures.length == signers.length * 2`)

Returns `true` if the header was successfully verified and stored, reverts otherwise.

#### verifyTx(bytes transaction, uint256 txIndex, uint256 blockHeight, bytes32\[] proof) returns (bool success)

Verifies that `transaction` was included in the header at `blockHeight` by running a proof of inclusion using `proof` and comparing the result with the transactions hash of the header. Once the transaction has been proven to have been included in the block, the value and denomination of the first output of the transaction will be minted and sent to the Ethereum address included in the addition data field of the output.

* `transaction`: the bincode serialized Themelio transaction, in `bytes`
* `txIndex`: the transaction's index within the block, as `uint256`
* `blockHeight`: the block height of the header `transaction` is included in, as `uint256`
* `proof` - an array of the sibling hashes comprising the Merkle proof, as `bytes32[]`

Returns `true` if the header was successfully verified and stored, reverts otherwise.

#### burn(address account, bytes32 txHash, bytes32 themelioRecipient)

Burns tokens owned by `account` with the value and denom specified by the locked Themelio coin with transaction hash `txHash`. If successful the burned coin's status will be updated to be `themelioRecipient`, indicating the coin has been burned and claimed, to allow unlocking on the Themelio network.

* `account`: the account owning the tokens to be burned
* `txHash`: the transaction hash of the Themelio coin to be released (the coin will always be considered the first output of that transaction)
* `themelioRecipient`: the address to release the burned coin to on the Themelio network

#### burnBatch(address account, bytes32\[] txHashes, bytes32 themelioRecipient)

Can burn multiple denominations of `account`'s tokens at a time by using the `txHashes` array to list the transaction hash of each coin to be burned.

* `account`: the account owning the tokens to be burned
* `txHashes`: an array of transaction hashes of Themelio coins to be released (the coin will always be considered the first output of that transaction)
* `themelioRecipient`: the address to release the burns assets to on the Themelio network

### Rust client implementation

Additionally, to safely and conveniently streamline interaction with FancyName, a client has been implemented in Rust which abstracts away the complexity of querying the chain state and crafting compliant transactions on both networks. It is packaged as a simple-to-use CLI application whose source code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/themeliolabs/bridge-cli).

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: currently fancyname-cli requires the user to manually send their locking and unlocking transactions to the Themelio network via the melwallet-cli application; this will be automated away in an upcoming update.
{% endhint %}

### Rust client API

#### mint-tokens

In order to mint your Themelio tokens on Ethereum, you must first lock your coins up using [melwallet-cli](developer-guides/using-wallets/) as specified in the covenant API. Once you do this you can supply the block height and transaction hash of your lock transaction to fancyname-cli as such: `fancyname-cli mint-tokens --block-height BLOCK_HEIGHT --tx-hash TX_HASH`. The application will automatically take care of everything needed to mint your tokens and will provide you with a receipt of the mint transaction on Ethereum.

#### burn-tokens

To unlock your Themelio coins, you must first burn their equivalent on the Ethereum network and provide the FancyName covenant with a proof of this burn. To automate this process, you can use the command `fancyname-cli burn-tokens --themelio-address THEMELIO_ADDRESS`. Fancyname-cli will take care of burning the correct amount of tokens and crafting the melwallet-cli command which will release the unlocked coin to the Themelio address you provided.

## Next steps

In this guide, we learned about both the function and architecture of FancyName and how it is powered by the native security of both Themelio and Ethereum. In the next section we will learn how we can help strengthen the security of the Themelio network ourselves by participating in staking.
