**This page is still WIP.**

Our old documentation website has more on:

* The design of our [collusion-tolerant consensus incentives](https://docs.themelio.org/basic-concepts/03-consensus/)
* A whitepaper on [Synkletos, the "monopoly simulating" fee system](https://docs.themelio.org/whitepapers/synkletos/) driving these incentives
* [A somewhat outdated detailed spec](https://docs.themelio.org/specifications/consensus-spec/) of the consensus mechanism, which touches on its exceptionally long "weak subjectivity period"
