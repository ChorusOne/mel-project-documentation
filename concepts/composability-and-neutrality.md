**This page is still WIP.**&#x20;

Check out the old docs on our [TXO-based data model](https://docs.themelio.org/basic-concepts/02-state/) and [strong governance-free neutrality](https://docs.themelio.org/basic-concepts/01-endogenous-trust/), as well a blogpost on [how governance-freedom synergizes with an off-chain composable ecosystem](https://www.nullchinchilla.me/web3/against-blockchain-governance).
