# Data model and neutrality

{% hint style="warning" %}
**This page is still WIP.**&#x20;

Check out the old docs on our [TXO-based data model](https://docs.themelio.org/basic-concepts/02-state/) and [strong governance-free neutrality](https://docs.themelio.org/basic-concepts/01-endogenous-trust/), as well a blogpost on [how governance-freedom synergizes with an off-chain composable ecosystem](https://www.nullchinchilla.me/web3/against-blockchain-governance).

## Mel's data model: superpowered coins

The **data model** of a blockchain

A key way on-chain logic with "web3 superpowers" can be exported off-chain is through Mel's **data model**: how on-chain data and logic is organized.&#x20;

Mel uses a unique _coin-based_ (or UTXO-based) data model, a family including many of the earliest blockchains, like Bitcoin and Litecoin. We go into more detail into the differences in a [separate blogpost](https://medium.com/themelio/utxos-vs-accounts-54b3bbeb4428), but the main difference is that unlike account-based blockchains like Ethereum, Mel has no concept of "contracts" or "accounts".
